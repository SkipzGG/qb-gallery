# Simple Selling Script

Original Script: https://github.com/MonkeyWhisper/mw-shopseller

* This script is a original fork from mw-shopseller by MonkeyWhisper. This is made for the Art Gallery with the Honeynut art gallery mlo. This is a player run business that allows players to sell gems, paintings, and other items that can be easily changed in the config with pricing. A built in pay  register since you will be paying customers money that comes directly out of the business boss menu. Employees get a commision for making payments to other characters. Fully functional and box zones can easily be changed with little to no coding experience. 

* You can add more items on the Config.

Again this script was not my idea, it was origannily mw-shopseller and redesigned.
